# Timed-Javascript-Quiz

## About this project
In this project I was tasked with building a timed quiz on basic JavaScript knowledge. I created two html page to complete this using bootstrap for basic styling. Using timers,
for loops and eventListeners I was able to complete the function of the quiz creating its buttons for each set of answers on each of the questions and was able to store the scores outside of local storage and append it to a scores list that sorts high to low scores.
